= Identify the problem
In order to precisely identify the problem, we will analyse what worked well about our current solution and what didnt.
= What went well
It was able to score consistently at lower RPMs

= To be improved
As mentioned previously, the intake struggled with initially sucking in rings since it was angled too far downwards, which meant that a ring would lift up the entire intake whilst it slid underneath the flex wheels. This generally meant that our intake wasn't as clean as we would like it to be. Additionally, our intake ramp touched the floor, which increased drive friction.

= What we want
Moving forwards we want an intake solution, which:
- can suck in rings without external help
- doesn't lift much when intaking
- has a ramp that is flush with the floor but not actually touching it
