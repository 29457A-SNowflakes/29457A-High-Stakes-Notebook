= The interest of time
In order to compete as effectively as we can we want to improve our overall performance as much as possible. The three constiuent parts that affect this broadly fall under one or more of these 3 categories:
- robot design
- autonomous routines
- driver skill.
\Ultimately, effective time management of these three aspects is vital for robotic success within the world of VEX. It is also important to note that we can not overcommit ourselves to VEX or work inconsistently on this project in order not to overburden the team and cause social and academic burnout.
\
\
Additionally, we must consider the order in which we implement changes noting that rebuilding tasks can generally not be done in parallel with driver practice or autonomous. Also building should be done before programming because its important that for as much time as possible we have a functional robot within the scope of the game's meta because that allows for more practice time and also more time to tune auton and secondly it is taken as a given that any changes in terms of drivers practice or autonomous routine will be renderred useless because of the many micro adjustments in a rebuild.
\
\
That all being said we are most likely to approach the time before the upcoming competition by firstly recadding/building then improving autonomous and getting in drivers practice simultaneously. Below we shall discuss what we have planned to change in terms of our robot's design based on performance in the most recent competition (as of time of writing), which was the JWS regional.
