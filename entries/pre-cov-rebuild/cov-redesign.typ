= Intent With the Bot 
With this vertion of the bot we hope to improve last desing witch was fundementaly good but was a flawed execution further more the desing was limited in the possible improvment and aditions that could be made e.g. no room or posiblity for a ring mech.
Therephore we need a robot with://
- Fast and reliable drive train 
- Consistent mogo ring scoring 
- Strong mogo mech 
- Smooth and consistent first stage intake 
- Doinker that leaves the botom ring 
- The posiblity of adding a wall steaks (Not comited to it due to time constraints)

//
= Design
== Drive train 
The drive train was good the main improvement that needs to be made is the fact that there was not enough room in the front of the drive train to full acomodate an optimal first stage intake due to how the drive was brace however there was extra room in the back near the mogo mech. Change the side considered the front of the drive. Our soution was to simply flip witch side of the drive was considered the front of the robot.

== First Stage
For the first stage intake we went with simple flex weel intake rollers however in order to improove upon the last we changed the intake ramp inseting it further into the robot along with having a more favourable contact angle with the ring (the pervious bot had the intake ramp hiting the ring before the rollers).

== Secound Stage 
For the scound stage we desided on a central pillar with hooks similar to the first desing only with a shalower gradient and a longer hooks stage. At the top there is a much simpler ring gard. This is compatible with a possible wall stakes mech.

== Mogo Mech 
The JWS mogo Mech was good however it requires the room we realocated to the front of the robot in order to work. Therephore in order to save space we switched to a class 2 leaver witch is a bit less secure but far more space effictiant.

== Doinker
We changed the Doinker from structure from a peace of 1x1 to a peace of 2x - C-chan. We did this because the original doinker was not strong enough and kept bending we had to unbened it after every match. The 2x is much stronger due its shape.
