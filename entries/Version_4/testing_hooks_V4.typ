Testing for our nationals robot is paramount as we need it to perform at the highest level, all the time, therefore the testing regimen that we have used for our previous robots must be adapted to show the higher level of challenge that nationals presents. Our usual tests will be put in a different context to show how the new robot can stand the heat of actual competition.

== Test 1:
First and foremost we conduct our usual test for all the robots we have created this season, by hand loose chain flip of the ring on the conveyor.
- place ring on the loose conveyor.
- hold mogo at smallest distance from edge of hook 
- push chain at high speed
- observe whether scored
on this robot scoring must be as clean as possible, that is there is no "iffy" about whether a ring scores, the ring should transfer from the conveyor to the bottom of the mogo no arguments.
