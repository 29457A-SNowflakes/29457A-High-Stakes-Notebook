= My role and the Manual
As head of tactics, we decided that it should be my responisiblity to know absolutely everything in the game manual, so, if it comes to it in a match, I would be able to work out the best stratergy in certain situations that would get us more points, or be able to stop us from getting violations in other cases.

Over the summer, I spent a lot of my time memorising the manual, so I would be ready for our first competition, and I was excited to see what would change in the September 3rd update , which was the first major update of the manual since its release. These next few pages will summarise the key things that i took out of this update, and the impact that i think they will have on the game subsequently. 

= Field tape layout
#align(center)[
  #grid(columns: 2, gutter: 20pt,
    [#figure(image("./before-tape.jpeg", height: 120pt, width: 120pt), caption: [Field before update @manual])],
    [#figure(image("./after-tape.jpeg", height: 120pt, width: 120pt), caption: [Field after update @manual])],
  )
]

This is one of the most major changes in this manual update, as it not only greatly reduces the amount of space for the mobile goals, but it also makes it so it will be much easier to tell whcih mobile goal is considered scored. It is also relevant to note that the placed mobile goal criteria in SC5, and now the 3 criteria are:
+ The mobile goal is contacting the floor/tape line
+ A part of the flexible top is above the field perimeter
+ The mobile goal is breaking the plane of the corner

I believe part 2 and 3 are especially significant, as in the previous version, the stake didn't need to be as 'upright', and this change makes it so its harder to score, as if the stake is tipped over by the opposing alliance, it will not get the corner modifier.

Part 3 is also significant as the rule used to be so the base of the stake must contact the floor of the corner, but now the edge of the base can just overhang, making it slightly easier for the mobile goal to be considered as placed.

= SC3 rewrite
In my opinion, this is the single biggest strategic change to the game manual, and will greatly impact many future matches. SC3 used to have 4 conditions:
+ Rings cannot touch the floor
+ Rings cannot be touching the same colour robot
+ Rings must be encirling the stake
+ Rings cannot exceed the maximum nhumber of rings for the stake

However, the new SC3 rule overhauled these conditons, and only made the last 2 relevant. THIS IS LITERALLY GAME CHANGING! Because of this update, if a ring is 'on' a stake, it is pretty much guarunteed to be scored, whereas before, teams had to think about whether their robot was touching the rings or if the stake is toppled over, but now these 2 conditions are irrelevant. This will make scoring much easier, and i can imagine we will see many more points given to both teams in future games.


= AWP for NATS/Worlds

In the september update, we finally got the conditions for the AWP for worlds and nationals competitions. This year, we are determined to try and have a robot which can solo Auton for an AWP, as i believe that AWP's are massively underrated, as they are worth 1/2 the points that winning a match is, and, if done well, can consistently be done.

I was expecting that the AWP would have maybe 1 more ring scored, something just slightly harder than the "normal" AWP, but how wrong I was. Now, the AWP forces you to have a ring on the alliance wall stake, and although it seems simple, I cannot stress enough just how much harder this will be. It will completely change the route of the robot and also means that the robot will have to pick up an extra ring. Although this seems easy, this forces the robot to get a ring from a pile stacked with the other alliances coloured rings, and for some robots, it will be difficult to seperate the blue from the red rings, potentially helping the opposing alliance with their autonomous bonus, making your alliance at a disadvantage before the driver controlled period even begins.

Althought the AWP is much harder to obtain,I believe this is a positive change, as, from my experience, in previous games, the AWP was sometimes too easy to get, and therfore the tournaments relied less on the actual driver controlled section and teams could easily get AWP's through the Autonomous Win Point. However, if a team can perfect their autonomous, they could consistently get the AWP, kbut this will require a lot of work and i belive its a good change.


= SG4 rewrite
Although many teams believe this rule is less significant, and some may glance over it completely, I once again believe this is an incredibly important rewrite. SG4 used to state that if a ring left the field, it would result in a minor violation for the team, and 3 rings would cause a major violation, and therefore an automatic disqualification, and this would apply for any future games too.

This would stop teams from trying to descore even-points neutral wall stakes, as there would be the fear of pushing the rings out of the field instead of back onto the floor tiles, and therefore would incentivise teams to put rings on a wall stake that allready has some of the other alliances rings as they knew there would be little risk of another team trying to descore, as they would be worried that they would descore their own rings, and possibly get a violation, as well as losing some of their own points.

However, due to the new rule only applying to the enemy alliance's rings, this means teams will feel more comfortable descoring their own rings, as there is less risk of getting a violation. I believe this rule change makes more sense, as teams shouldn't be puished for losing their own points.
