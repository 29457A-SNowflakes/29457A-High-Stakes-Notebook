As well as this plan - as discussed in Managing the Team - we communicate and meet often and in a variety of ways: in person, Discord, Trello and Whatsapp. As a final sprint effort, we have all agreed to up the amount of work, which we normally do for robotics. We have also agreed on some goals:
- Completely redesign our bot (Deadline: 14th)
- Tuning, drivers practise and autons in a good state (Deadline: 23rd)
- Cleanup the notebook (Deadline: 25th)
