= Optimisation
The ultimate plan for this rebuild is: Optimisation. We want to improve on and redesign the weakest aspects of our robot's design and additionally we want to take the parts of our bot, which worked well to the greatest potential. Since our current bot was built largely in the span of a week there are many things, which were rushed or cut for the sake of time. The main issues of our current design were:
- The mogo struggled with clamping and aligning
- High centre of mass
- Too heavy
- Intake would jam occasionally
- We didn't have enough time for autons

The most consistent/best part of our bot was:
- The wall stake mech
- Ring mech scoring
- Dewie's driving

= Moving onwards
Our next competition is the 4th January, in which neither Jonah nor Aubert can make due to holidays, and we have approximately 1 month and 3 weeks until then. In this time, we need to relax as we are all very tired from this competition and 4 out of the 5 members on this team are involved in the school musical, which takes up almost the entirety of the week commencing the 18th November.\
\
Once that is done, we can discuss what problems require the most urgent attention and what strengths can be improved the easiest. After we have this discussion, we can move into the design phase, creating mockups and eventually creating CAD for what we want our new bot to become.\
\
Once we have CAD, we can work on dismantling and reconstructing our robot. We have decided in advance to keep our current drive train the same since as mentioned previously we spent a lot of time getting that right. However, we will spend some time checking the friction of our drive and the power that it draws.\
\
With our brand new robot, we can work on driver practice and autonomous routine's in parallel. As soon as our autonomous routines are consistent, we can focus all of our attention on drills/practice and maybe even a scrimage with 1875N Noodle with hopefully a week or so to spare before Birmingham.
