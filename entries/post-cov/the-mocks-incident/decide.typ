= How we overcome this
Before continuing we have to reign back, the scope of our bot and fix/do *only what is critical* within our timeframe. In order to overcome this challenge, we are going to try do as much work on the bot, whilst keeping on top of school, before term ends. Afterwards, someone will take the robot home for Christmas and work on it when they can, and those who can will meet up in orde to help. After much discussion, we have worked out what needs to change. Since we no longer have the time to comfortably get it working we can no longer utilise a direct mech for wall stakes. Here's a new list of proposed changes below:
- Improved mogo clamp
- Redesigned Intake
- Adjusted Centre of Mass

#admonition(type:"note")[
  Unfortunately, we were unable to go to the Birmingham regional since 3 out of our 5 team members were unable to make the competition due to prior commitments. Therefore, we decided that it wouldn't be worth it as we wouldn't be able to have a full drive team. Instead we felt it was worth concentrating on getting our V3 bot working to high standards.
