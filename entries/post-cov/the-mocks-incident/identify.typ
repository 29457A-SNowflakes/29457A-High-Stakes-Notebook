= The Problem
We have come into school today and we have been told that, the robotics space needs to be shut and that we can no longer use it, as it being used as an exam hall for the mocks going on in our school, after an initial promise that we were guranteed this space. In addition, only two out of the five members are able to go to Birmingham due to holidays and other prior commitments.

= What this means for us
Today is the Monday 2nd of December, school ends in two weeks on the 13th. This means that we are going to have to spend approximately a week out of dwindling time till Birmingham on the 4th, in order to pack up, find a temporary relocation and resume work on the building of the robot. Ultimately, this delay will put us behind schedule by at least two weeks and effectively we have less than a month to get everything done. This means that we can't achieve everything that we wanted to as set out in decide. Three things are clear:
- We will not have time to tune a direct wall stake mech
- We will have to work through Christmas break
- We will not be able to tune autonomous due to a lack of a field.
