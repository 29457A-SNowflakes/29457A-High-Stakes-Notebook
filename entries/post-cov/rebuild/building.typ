= Building the:

== Drive 
We rebuilt the same drive we where using from scrach but wuth more atention to detail and maged to get the friction down to 0.1W so esentialy negligable 
//picture of Drive
== First Stage and Chain Reversal 
The whole construction of the first stage intake including chain revarsa was flawless thanks to the cad forplaning with the slight exeption of ramp bracing where standofs to close to the slope witch this slowed and mesed with the transition of the rings. It was not a big isue and easly resoved by driling a new whole slighly mor inset

== Mogo mech
The mogo mech was largley flawless thanks to the CAD. Required minimal tuning. the only slight isue is that the secound prongs where abrasive enought to somtimes catch on the edge of the mogo causing it to not score properly however all we had to do to resove this was sand down the riviest on the side contacting the mogo and the isure was resolved

== secound stage intake
In the secound stage intake we encoundterd issues. when we first built it the ring only scored roughly 1/8 times after extensive testing we concluded that it was due to the placement of the hooks being roughly 0.5in to low. This in of of its self was not terible we just atached a peace of 1x1 to extend the legth of he central pilar slightly. after quite a bit of tuning and stweeking tight marging we had scoring and a verry consistant level.

== wall staks mech 
The wall staks mech was verry based around the position of the end oof the secound stage intake witch move due to a slight error in the CAD however this had the knok on effec that the beatifly planded and caded wall steaks mech needed to be changed the tuning cliping and micro ajustments needed to make this work(e.g. carfully cuting the metal in a way so that it would slot in at a diagonal because that is the only angleis could reach the top of the stakea) was probably the bigest job apart from the drive. but eventualy we sucseeded in fixing tit and gaind the ability to score with it.

== Doinker 
The doinker was easitly eicuted as it was unchaged.
