At JWS some of the top teams had wall stakes mechanism, which gave them extra leeway in matches and could act as a handy tie breaker in situations where they haven't secured AB. We believe that ignoring this aspect of design for the next contest will be detrimental to our performance. Our criteria for this system are that they must:
- *Reliably* score rings onto wall stakes
- Have a faster cycle time to allow placement of several rings in quick succession
