== Recap of building constraints 
Whilst we planed for the likley posibility of having 
wallstakes mech capabilityes we prioritised having a 
robot that was viable even without and add it if there 
was time to add it. thphore there where certain spce 
constraint aswell as the fact that not every posibility 
had been though through competly. For exaple there was 
not enough space to tuck the wall steaks mech as low as
 is tipical and optimal howerver the was minimal copared 
 to other problems we ran into later.


= Building
== Gear Ration
We began by instaling gears in a 12 to 72 gear ratio in 
order to acheave a 6x gear down from 200rpm to 33.3rpm 3.s.f. This gave us prisice and managble controlle we did this 
because we valued the ability to ensure you score the 
ring rather that doing faster but less acuretly and 
potential fail to score it.

== Main structure and bracing 
For the main structure we dicided to 2 main 2x C -chan 
arms with grip pads in flaired 3x - chan. The 2x C -chan 
is extreamly strong and unlilkey to bend. The 3x c -chan 
is the corect widthe to acomodat and grip a ring well. 
Flairing the edges increases the tolerace posible with how 
presisce the ring aproch and hieght has to be. Additionaly 
we used standoff X bracing to renforec the whole thing. This 
would help keep the "arms" level with one another and prevent
gear skipping on one side or the other witch would cause the 
wallstakes mech to lose the ability to grip rings.

== The problem 
During testing (see page 146) we discoverd the due to the
leght of the arms and where they began the where incapable
of reaching the top of the wall steaks at first this was
quite a daunting problem as we could not simply extend the
lenght of the arms as they would no longer be in the corect 
range to acsept rings and moving the end point of the 
secound stage intake would have been to great a task.
//diagam of problem
We quicly came up with a relativly simple solution to the 
problem by moving the starting postition of the wallstakes mech 
further foward on the robot. We did this by slighly extending 
c-chan it was mounted on and then reataching it.
