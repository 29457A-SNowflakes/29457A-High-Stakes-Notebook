= What is a Programming 'Approach'
When tackling any project, thorough planning and thought is required to allow the team to effectively solve it. Defining a standard approach to certain aspects of the challenge can allow certain beneficial procedures to become instinctual, therefore allowing the team to become more efficient.\
This is especially prominent when looking at programming, code on large projects can become completely unorganised and hard to read -- which is particularly disastrous if you are in a team (where some or most of the members might not intuitively understand the programming language itself).
== Common Approaches To Programming
Some aspects of code are typically defined by some form of rule or guideline, examples include:
- Variable naming conventions
- Usage of subprograms or classes
- Choosing a language
- Version or project management
- Program structure
- Safe and secure programming
== TL;DR
Standardised programming -- through usage of the above -- helps to improve:
- Team communication
- Debugging
- Team/project management
- Readabilty of code
- Enjoyment of writing code
