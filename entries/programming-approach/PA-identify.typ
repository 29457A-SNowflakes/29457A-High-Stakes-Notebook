= What is a Programming 'Approach'
When tackling any project, thorough planning and thought is required to allow the team to effectively solve it. Defining a standard approach to certain aspects of the challenge can allow certain beneficial procedures to become instinctual, therefore allowing the team to become more efficient.\
This is especially prominent when looking at programming, code on large projects can become completely disorganised and hard to read -- which is particularly disastrous if you are in a team (where some or most of the members might not intuitively understand the programming language itself).
== Common Approaches To Programming
Some *programming best practices* which we wish to implement in our code of conduct are:
- Choosing a suitable language
- Consistent variable naming conventions
- Usage of subprograms or classes
- Version control or project management
- Program structure
- Safe and secure programming
== TL;DR
All code written for robotics should follow a standardised set of principals, which are designed to enforce the best practises outlined above. By following the principals we design we should improve the following (ranked in order of importance: high to lower):
+ Team/project management
+ Team communication
+ Readability of code
+ Debugging efficiency
+ Enjoyment of writing code
+ Programming speed
