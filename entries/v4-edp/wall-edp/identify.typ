= Looking at our Current Mech
We are going to look at the good and bad aspects of our current wall stakes mech.

= What worked well
Our current wallstakes mech was able to score rings onto neutral stakes consistently and fairly quickly. We were able to use our two bar mech in some matches in order to tip mogos, which was able to pull mogos out of positive and negative corners.

= What could be improved
Our two bar mechanism was fairly heavy since it was made out of C-Channel pieces.

= Our focus
These are the requirements for our wallstakes mech and all its aspects:
- Must score consistently
- Should score quickly
- Should be light
