After competing in Stowe and Essex with our V3 bot, we realised that whilst it was good bot there were a number of limitations, which restricted our competitve potential. We also know of the importance of keeping up drivers practice in order to stay sharp. Our sister teams and our own team have enough parts left over for us to largely make a whole new bot in parallel to our V3 bot. The advantages of building in parallel to our existing robot version is as mentioned we can go to competitions, mid-way through building a new robot, additionally it means that we have a fallback option since we won't dismantle our current bot until we are satisfied that this new bot is a strict upgrade, which takes pressure off of the building process.

We have two competitions in which we are competing in before Nationals, one in Nottingham and the other in Newcastle. We hope to finish building our V4 bot shortly after Newcastle and get most of autons done during half term.

As well as this plan - as discussed in Managing the Team - we communicate and meet often and in a variety of ways: in person, Discord, Trello and Whatsapp. As a final sprint effort, we have all agreed to up the amount of work, which we normally do for robotics. We have also agreed on some goals:
- Completely redesign our bot (Deadline: 14th)
- Tuning, drivers practise and autons in a good state (Deadline: 23rd)
- Cleanup the notebook (Deadline: 25th)
