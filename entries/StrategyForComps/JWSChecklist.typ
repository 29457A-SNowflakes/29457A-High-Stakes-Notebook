On the 28th of September we are attending the regional competition at The John Warner School in Hoddeston, as with any competition we cannot take the whole workshop with us, we must travel light and pack efficiently. 

= Packing for JWS
Before the competition begins, we must ensure that we bring everything we need to compete, while also keeping spare parts for the sake of redundancy. Shown below is the list of things we must bring with us:
\
- Robot (obviously)
- Battery X2 (with charger)
- Screws 
- Nuts 
- Long C Channel (for quick replacements)
- All pistons (in case we have an unexpeccted malfunction)
- Pit decorations
- Saw (quick replacements/adherences, that require cuts)
- Rubber bands 
- Laptop (last minute code adjustments)
- Liscence plates (red and blue)
- Fan (for cooling overheated motors)
- Zipties 
- Controller 
- Pneumatic pump (with charger)
- Safety Glasses (per S1)
- Drill
