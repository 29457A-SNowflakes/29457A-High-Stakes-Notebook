= Drivetrain Selection Process
The process of selecting a drivetrain is a teams first thoughts when considering the needs for a robot in any given VEX season.
The benefits and drawbacks of all types of drivetrain are considered at this point of the design cycle, in the context of the current game of course, many different options are considered as the different parts that VEX provides can be combined in many different ways in order to give each drivetrain a different characteristic as it were. 
== Considerations for any given drivetrain
At the beginning of any season the needs of the three main aspects of a drivetrain are pitted against each other in the context of the needs of the current game, these three main features are: 
- Torque 
- Speed 
- Size 
\ 
=== Torque: 
torque is defined as the force that causes rotation, the more torque that a specific drivetrain has the more power it will exert onto something it is pushing against, the more we have of this on our drivetrain which can be altered by the *gear ratio* the higher amount fo force we will be able to exert on another robot therefore being able to win pushing matches and achieve higher scores, the downside of having increased torque is the loss of speed as the relationship between the two is inversely proportional 
\
==== Speed:
Speed is defined as the rate at which something moves or is able to move, as is quite obvious the higher speed that a drivetrain has the faster it will be able to move about the field, thereby increasing the rate at which we are able to score, however one of the drawbacks of increased speed is the relationship achievable with VEX parts of a manageable torque-speed relationship means that higher speeds where a significant edge is given in game also leads to a major drawback in the amount of torque exerted, therefore the tradeoff may not be worth it, also high amounts of speed can be difficult for the driver to control accurately 
===== Size:
It is also necessary to consider the size of each drivetrain option when selecting as it can be the killing blow in relation to the rest of the mechanisms planned to be on the robot as the size of the drivetrain can affect the balance of the robot when it is completed, especially within this game where a good balance and centre of mass is necessary for efficient scoring and for a climb to be doable further down the line. However, a large drivetrain can  affect the rest of the mechanisms through its own obstruction such as things like the intake which if forced to be too large can become jammed and remove the ultimate goal we have, scoring.
