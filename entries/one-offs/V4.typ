= Why Version 4?
After the competition at Stowe School we observed some fundamental issues with Version 3 of our robot that cannot be fixed without a major overhaul/rebuild. With other competitions in the very near future, a complete rebuild is not possible in the timeframe we have given ourselves. 

= What then?
there are a few solutions that we could enact. 
- not attend the next two competitions.
- rebuild partially with a compromised build between competitions.
- do a *parallel* rebuild while keeping the Version 3 Robot competition viable until not in use anymore.
