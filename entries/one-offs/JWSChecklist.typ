On the 28th of September we are attending the regional competition at The John Warner School in Hoddeston, as with any competition we cannot take the whole workshop with us, we must travel light and pack efficiently. 

= Packing for JWS
Before the competition begins, we must ensure that we bring everything we need to compete, while also keeping spare parts for the sake of redundancy. Shown below is the list of things we must bring with us:
\
- Robot (obviously)
- Battery X2 (with charger)
- Screws 
- Nuts 
- Long C Channel (for quick replacements)
- All pistons (in case we have an unexpected malfunction)
- Pit decorations
- Saw (quick replacements/adherences, that require cuts)
- Rubber bands 
- Laptop (last minute code adjustments)
- Licence plates (red and blue)
- Fan (for cooling overheated motors)
- Zipties 
- Controller 
- Pneumatic pump (with charger)
- Safety Glasses (per S1 @manual)
- Drill

= Crisis Management at JWS
While this seems like a dramatic caption, we need to define clear and easy to fillow guidlines for if something goes wrong.
== Failure During Match
Handling a failure (non-driving) during a match can be handled like this:

= Reconnaissance at JWS
Usually, before a competition we like to refer to our notes and social media to see not only which teams and robots would be possible threats, but also which teams we would want on our alliance. Unfortunately ,  because this is the first competition of the season, we have very limited information (if any!) about the other teams, so we have to go into the competition "blind" and rely solely on our scouting at the beginning, adn throughout the competition.

As head of strategy, it is my role to go round to all the other teams at the start of the competition and make notes on a variety of things, such as, but not limited to:
- *Autonomous*
  - Do they have solo AWP Autonomous?
  - Can they do an Autonomous from both sides or just the one?
  - Do they have multiple Autonomouses and if so which one works best with our robot?
  - Is the Autonomous reliable?
  - Do they even have an Automnomous??
- *Robot limitations*
  - Can they score on Neutral Wall Stakes?
  - What level can the robot climb to? ( if it can climb at all)
  - Can the Robot descore?
  - Can it even possess rings or mogos?
- *General build quality*
  - Is it a fast robot?
  - Does it break / fall apart easily?
  - Is the intake reliable?
- *Does it work well with our robot?*
  - Does the Autonomous intefere with ours?
  - Can they score on the neutral stakes if we can't?
  
All these factors play a massive part in helping us formulate a strategy for a game to game basis, for example, if we know that both opponents have an auton that only works on one side, we can confidently do a slightly riskier autonomous on the other side, as we know there is less chance of an entanglement / interaction at the Autonomous line, and less chnance of getting a violation in rules such as G11 and G12. Controversially, these facts also help us in choosing an Alliance partner (if we get there), as we can decide on a robot that works nicely with our robot, for example having a support Autonomous on the other side, and are a team, who we believe, will help us in (hopefully!) becoming Tournament Champions.

= At the pit checklist
+ Motors are plugged In
+ Sensors are plugged In
+ All breaks are repaired from the last Match
+ All screws must be tight
+ Pneumatic pump is locatable
+ Check length of skills queue
+ Colour of next Alliance

= At the field checklist
+ Safety Glasses
+ Pneumatic pumped
+ Battery
+ Controller
+ Drive-team members
+ Robot drive is working
+ Robot intake is working
+ Plates are on and correct
