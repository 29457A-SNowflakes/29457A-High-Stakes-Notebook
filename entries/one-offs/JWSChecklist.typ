On the 28th of September we are attending the regional competition at The John Warner School in Hoddeston, as with any competition we cannot take the whole workshop with us, we must travel light and pack efficiently. 

= Packing for JWS
Before the competition begins, we must ensure that we bring everything we need to compete, while also keeping spare parts for the sake of redundancy. Shown below is the list of things we must bring with us:
\
- Robot
- Battery x2 (with charger)
- Screws 
- Nuts 
- Long C-Channel (for quick replacements)
- All pistons (in case we have an unexpected malfunction)
- Pit decorations
- Saw (quick replacements/adherences, that require cuts)
- Rubber bands 
- Laptop (last minute code adjustments)
- Licence plates (red and blue)
- Fan (for cooling overheated motors)
- Zipties 
- Controller 
- Pneumatic pump (with charger)
- Safety Glasses (per S1 @manual)
- Drill

= Crisis Management at JWS
While this seems like a dramatic caption, we need to define clear and easy to fillow guidlines for if something goes wrong.
== Failure During Match
Handling a failure (non-driving) during a match can be handled like this:

= Reconnaissance at JWS
Usually, before a competition we like to refer to our notes and social media to see not only which teams and robots would be possible threats, but also which teams we would want on our alliance. Unfortunately,  because this is the first competition of the season, we have very limited information about the other teams. So we have to go into the competition "blind" and rely solely on our scouting at the beginning, and throughout the competition.

Our strategist, Thomas Robb, will speak with other teams and make notes on their bot on things such as:
- *Autonomous*
  - Do they have a solo AWP?
  - What sides do they have autonomous?
  - What side autonomous works best with our bot?
  - Is their autonomous reliable?
- *Robot*
  - Can they score on neutral wall stakes?
  - What level can the robot climb to?
  - Can their robot descore?
  - Can it possess rings or mogos?
  - Is their intake reliable?
  - What RPM is their drive?
  - Does they utilise good building practises such as boxing?
  
All these factors play a massive part in helping us formulate a strategy for a game to game basis. For example, if we know that both opponents have an auton that only works on one side, we can confidently do a slightly riskier autonomous on the other side, as we know there is less chance of an entanglement / interaction at the Autonomous line, and less chance of getting a violation in rules such as G11 and G12. Additionally, these facts also help us in choosing an Alliance partner, and help us make an informed list of which robots are most likely to help us win the tournament. For example having a support Autonomous in the other quadrant.

= Preparation
We have a couple of checklists, which we go through, whilst in the pits and before matches.
== At the pit checklist
+ Motors are plugged in
+ Sensors are plugged in
+ All breaks are repaired from the last match
+ All screws must be tight
+ Pneumatic pump is locatable
+ Check length of skills queue
+ Check colour of next alliance

== At the field checklist
+ Safety glasses
+ Pneumatic pumped
+ Battery
+ Controller
+ Drive-team members
+ Robot drive is working
+ Robot intake is working
+ Plates are on and correct
