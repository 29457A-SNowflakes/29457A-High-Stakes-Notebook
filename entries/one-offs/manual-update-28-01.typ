= Manual Update 3.0
On the 28th of January, we werer blessed with our highly anticipated second major game manual update. After the first one changing the corners to traingels, as well as many other major rule changes such as allowing rings on mobile goals to be scored even if they are touching teh ground. many members of the vex community were very excited to see what this update would have in store for us, and how our game strategies and tactics would change. Needless to say, the game manual did not dissappoint.

== How High stakes changed:
It would be an insult to the manual if I didnt start this page with the rewrite of rule SG11; positive corner protection.
For those who don't konw, SG11 used to state that "Positive corners are protected during the endgame. During the last fifteen (15) seconds of a Match, Robots may not contact Mobile Goals that are Placed in the Positive Corners of the Field..."
At most of the competition we went to(particularly Essex), we would often see teams get a full mobile goal of rings before placing it in a positive corner, and guarding it until the last 15 seconds, before simply trying to score a few wall stakes or final rings, and potentially attempt a climb. I know i speak for a large part of the vex community when I say that, in most cases, the game would be over wiht about 45 seconds left, and the action-packed exciting game of high stakes would quickly turn into a simple game of just waiting in the corner, and, if your opposition had 2 full mogos, just watch preparing for your definite defeat knowing that there was nothing you could do to win.

However, this update changed all that.

 Sg11 now states that positive corners become protected at 30 seconds, and although 15 seconds doesnt seem like a lot more, you have to consider that V5RC is only 1:45 long, meaning that it is almost 30% of the game where you can't get double points. This change also means that there is less time for teams to get a full mobile goal, allowing for less points to be scored before the protected period, which, in turn, means that the game becomes more competitive towards the endgame, as there is more time for goals to be scored in negative corner, which therefore leads to more intense endgames throughout the competition.

 Once again, i am fully aware of how little these 15 seconds may sound, but they are so crucial throughout the match, and are a massive change in how the game is played, and in my opnion, this rule rewrite was a very good change from the GDC, and I think they have added a newer, fresher, and more competitive spin in the game.

 == Other rules to note:
  Apart from a few revised rules; SC9 was the only other significant change in the game manual, which means that scoring the high stake is now worth 6 points, as well as the 2 points climbing bonus, as well as the likely 12 point ladder climb. This means this is now worth 20 points! which is the equivalent of just over 2 full mobile goals! I belive although we probably wont see this affect matches in the uk, i expect that in more competitive areas like America and china, we will see more robots climbing to tier 3 and scoring the high stake.
