= Introduction
We went up to Newcastle for the North East Regional, here's a quick summary of the competition. In this competition, skills opened and closed before qualifiers so we shall summarise that first.

= Before the Competition
== The Dilemna
Whilst on the train platform, we realised that we had somehow forgotten our hooks mechanism and it wasn't on our bot. However, from the spare parts we had in our travel kit, we were able to create a two hook chain mechanism and managed to tune it so that it was arguably better than our current hooks. This tuning took up a good amount of the evening in our hotel room.

= The Competition
== Skills
For drivers skills we got a new personal best with 52 points total, which ties us for first in the UK in that category. For autonomous skills we got 4 points, which wasn't particularly good but we plan to focus on autonomous routines in future before Nationals since they have been a constant problem throughout the season for us. We finished skills in 2nd place by 1 point.

== Qualification
Qualifications went fairly well. We played every match very well and our only loss was due to a misplay from our alliance. We finished qualifications ranked second.

== Eliminations
In eliminations, first seed was rejected four times, which meant that our ideal choice 46846T Int and our reserve choice 54732B Team 1 were no longer options for alliance. We went with 71368A QESFC and went straight to Semi Finals, which we won by a large margin. We won the Finals against 1st seed 24-0, which meant that we won the tournament.

#admonition(type: "reflect")[
We had a lot of fun at this competition and spent quite a bit of time talking to other teams about Robotics, which was good. Since we were already qualified, the main purpose of this competition was to give us drivers practise. In addition, we were impressed with our ability to adapt and overcome to the problem presented by the hooks mech.
