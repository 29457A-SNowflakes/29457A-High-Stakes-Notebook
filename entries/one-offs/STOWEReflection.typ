= Introduction
After competing in the Stowe Regional, we have collated our thoughts about how it went.

= The Competition
== Qualification
We won our practise match, 71611A and us vs 54345A and 46037D but we got an autonomous DQ and we had problems grabbing the mogo at the start of the match with the final score being 13-19, the final score was much closer than we'd like it to be.\

Our first qualification Q3 match 3110C and us vs 14109B and 3116Z. We won our autonomous? and our driving was much better getting a full mogo quite quickly, but there was a couple rings which didn't properly score. We ended up going for a second mogo managing to half fill that missing a ring scored but regardless winning Q3 26-0.

Our next qualification Q5 was 6023R and us vs 3110C and 46037D. We won the autonomous for Q5 and played aggressively. We almost completely filled up our mogo in drivers practise and cleared out positive corner managing to get a sneaky 6th ring whilst waiting for corners to be protected. We managed to half fill a second mogo before time wining 30-9.

Q9 was us and 6023R vs 11552A and 54345A. We had an autonomous tie since 6023R had an issue with their motors meaning they didn't move off the line. We used our normal strategy and managed to win 23-8.

Q16 was us and 46037D vs 71611A and 6023J and Q19 was us and 46037B vs 6023S and 14109A.For both matches we played with similar strategy and tactics. We won both 25-5 and 29-3 respectively.

Our final qualification was Q21 with us and 282S vs 3116G and 3110D. This match started well, we managed to get a full mogo relatively quickly. However, 3110D were blocking us from scoring in one postive corner and the other positive corner was being contested by our alliance 282S meaning there was no corner for our stack to go in. Daniel decided tip the goal so it couldn't be grabbed by the opposing alliance. However, 3110D were able to untip our 6 ring goal using their doinker and managed to get it in the negative corner. We tried to get it out using our mogo instead of our doinker, which ended up wedging it in further. Fortunately, 3110D interferred with one of the positive corners, whilst they were protected. This meant they were immediately DQ'd and so we got win point and the win despite technically losing 9-0.
We finished qualifications in 1st place, which means that we are guaranteed 1st seed.
At this point we felt that either 282S and 3110D would have been our best alliance partner.

== Aliance Selection and Elimination
We allianced with 282S because we felt that they would have worked with our robot better and allowed us to play defensively. We want to play defensively because we don't want any chance of being DQ'd or getting mogos stolen like in Q21. In our QF match, 282S rushed positive corner and defended it, whilst we filled up a mogo to 6 rings.We won 31-0.

Our SF match was played well and we ended up winning 33-0.

Finals 1 was against 3110D and 6023R and we ended up getting an autonomous tie. However, before driver control our bot started moving forwards on its own, whilst not recieving any inputs. It turns out that we had a faulty connection, so they restarted the match. Finals 1(rerun) again resulted in an autonomous tie because our bot didn't score a ring on the auton. 282S spent almost the entire match guarding one of the positive corners, whilst we ended up filling up a mogo entirely and we waited for 15 seconds to go off. At this point, we knew we had won but we decided to score additionally onto wall stakes for some extra points. We won 20-11 and hence won the finals.
== Skills
For skills, we did one drivers run, we scored 21 points. Unfortunately, our intake broke as our battery got jammed, which limited how much we could score. We didn't win skills champion but if we had the time prior to this competition, we would have had been able to get an autonomous skills working and we would have almost certainly won skills champion.

= Notes From Team
It is sometimes very useful to note down what each person initially thinks, as often the 'face value' notes are the most useful to keep in mind.

In my opinion, this was an amazing competition and we did phenomenally. The biggest thing that needs doing now before Essex in my opinion is work on our autonomous. I decided to write this reflection whilst at the competition and edit it afterwards. This seems to have worked quite well and saves time so we shall most likely do this in future. However, it was especially necessary to do this given that we are competing in Essex tomorrow.

= Results and Reflection
In conclusion, the Stowe Regional was a really good competition for us as we have securred our first tournament championship ever. Getting this award from winning finals and coming first in quals measn that we succeeded in one of our season goals and are still on track for another one. We have succeeded in getting a place at nationals and have still made top 5th Seed for every competition, which we've went to, meaning we are still on track for: A Force to be Reckoned with. From here we plan to get in as much practise as possible in order to be at our most competitive for worlds. However, we plan to be more careful as well as we still had a few close calls - not all of which were our fault.
