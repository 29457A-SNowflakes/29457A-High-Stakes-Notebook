= Introduction
After competing in the Stowe Regional, we have collated our thoughts about how it went.

= The Competition
== Qualification
We won our practise match, 71611A and us vs 54345A and 46037D but we got an autonomous DQ and we had problems grabbing the mogo at the start of the match with the final score being 13-19, the final score was much closer than we'd like it to be.
Our first qualification Q3 match 3110C and us vs 14109B and 3116Z. We won our autonomous? and our driving was much better getting a full mogo quite quickly, but there was a couple rings which didn't properly score. We ended up going for a second mogo managing to half fill that missing a ring scored. We won Q3 26 - 0.

Our next qualification Q5 was 6023R and us vs 3110C and 46037D. We won the autonomous for Q5 and played aggressively. We almost completely filled up our mogo in drivers practise and cleared out positive corner managing to get a sneaky 6th ring whilst waiting for corners to be protected. We managed to half fill a second mogo before time wining 30-9.

Q9 was us and 6023R vs 11552A and 54345A. We had an autonomous tie since 6023R had an issue with their motors meaning they didn't move off the line. We used our normal strategy and managed to win 23-8.

Q16 was us and 46037D vs 71611A and 6023J.

Q19 was us and 46037B vs 6023S and 14109A.
