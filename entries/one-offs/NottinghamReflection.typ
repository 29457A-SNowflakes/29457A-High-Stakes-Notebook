= Introduction
After competing in the Nottingham regional, we have decided to give our thoughts. At this competition, the only award available was Tournament Champion, which was our goal to get.

= The Competition
== Qualification
Overall, qualifications went very well. We won our practice match by a large margin and won every practise match up until Q10 against Falcon due to a tactical misplay by our alliance partner. However, we managed to win the rest of our qualifiers ending up finishing qualifiers in first place, which means we have successfully defended our title as *a force to reckoned with*#footnote["see Managing the Team"] once again.

== Eliminations
For eliminations, we chose 6023F as our alliance partner as we thought that they would co-operate and synergise well with our robot and align with overall game strategy. Since we were no 1 seed and there were 16 teams we were automatically through to the semi finals. We won our semi finals match and made it through to finals, where we won 20-11 against 6023R and 1408H.

= Results and Reflection
We performed very well at this competition, since we managed to rank 1st in alliance selection and we went undefeated in eliminations, which won us the Tournament Champions award. Additionally, this competition served as good driver practice, which is especially important as Nationals are coming up at the end of this month.
