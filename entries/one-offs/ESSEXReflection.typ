= Introduction
After competing in the Essex Regional, we have decided to summarise the event.

= The Competition
== Qualification
Our first qualification Q3 was quite interesting, we were with 8346D and against 20785A and 10173A. Our alliance blocked the negative corner, whilst we filled our mogo and got it in the other positive corner. However, our driver left the corner undefended early thinking that it that it was 16 seconds left instead of 26. 20785A managed to descore our mogo into the negative corner. However, Daniel in the last seconds of the match was able to descore their mogo in the other corner and also managed to tip our mogo with the doinker so it was no longer in the corner - we learnt this trick from Q21 in Stowe yesterday.

Our second qualification Q7 was problematic, we managed to get autonomous bonus but our mogo mech wasn't working properly and so we struggled to score rings on the mogo. We ended up getting 4 of our rings plus one of the other rings on our mogo and failed to score a ring on our mogo mech. However, we drew the match because of our autonomous bonus. Q11 we also had consistency issues with the mogo clamp, which is beginning to be a pattern at this point.

Q18 was a good but tight match, our auton scored alliance stake and grabbed a mogo but we weren't aligned to score a ring. The most notable thing was that we tipped over our mogo and stole the oppositions mogo from the negative corner.

Q25 was against 15650C Memento Mori and it was a very close match. They got one one corner whilst we got the other...

Our final match Q27 we won and nothing particularly of note happened.

We finished qualifications in 9th place with 3 wins, 2 loses and 1 tie, which is not as good as we'd hope for.
== Aliance Selection and Elimination
We accepted 13765T MTS_Bubblegum's alliance proposition, which meant that we formed the 4th seed.
In quarter finals we played against 17711C and (), we won 18-17. However, they double possessed, which would have been match affecting had we lost.
In semi finals, we played against No 1 Seed 13765X MTS_R3START and 17711E Entropy. In that match, we played to the best of our ability with 13765T playing superb defense. Near the end of the match there was a close call where R3START touched the positive corner when protected, which could have been a DQ but the ref made the call that it wasn't, despite a lot of arguing from our alliance.

== Skills
We enterred one driver's skills and got a score of 22, placing us at 12th out of 14, meaning we didn't win skills.

= Notes From Team
It is sometimes very useful to note down what each person initially thinks, as often the 'face value' notes are the most useful to keep in mind.

= Results and Reflection
Overall, the competition wasn't the best for us but it wasn't outright terrible - despite winning no awards. At the competion, 15650C considered us for an alliance partner since they ranked 7th and we ranked 9th but due to the match schedule, some teams placed much higher than they should have and others placed much lower than they deserved. For many teams this made getting the alliance we wanted much harder than it should have been. Additionally, we managed to improve the consistency of our mogo clamp over the course of the competition, which meant that our ring scoring was much more reliable. In addition, it made good driver's practise for Daniel against some of the best teams in the UK.
