// TODO:
//* Thomas - step by step game analysis, what we shoulve done etc

= JWS analysis
Despite losing more thaan 1 game in this competition, i will only be focusing on the semifinal games that ultimately caused us to lose, as they were not only th emost significant, but also the most high strategy games that we could hav epossibly won if we played it another way. The first half on this 
section I will discuss the game that ended with a double disqualification, before moving on to the game that we lost, and that caused us to be eliminated from the competition.

=Match 1 (Double disqualification)
== Autonomous
Since the auton is all pre-coded, there is little to no strategy that can be applied during the autonomous period, only what the next course of action should be based on the other teams positions.

* insert picture of end of auton*
Here, you can see our robot has got "base control" of 2 MOGOS , having scored one red ring on both, which, despite being 1 less than our auton can do if done perfectly, is a good controlling start to the game. We can also see Entropy (our alliance member) controlling and possessing their own mobile goal, with a similar 1 red ring being scored.
One of the teams on the opposing alliance, Memento Mori, managed to get an impressive 2 blue rings on their MOGO, while their fellow alliance member, Gearers, didnt have an auton, and subsequently didn't move off the starting line throughout the period. This meant that, at this point in the game, we have more control over the field, but as you will soon see, this will quickly change.
