= Introduction
After discussing the results of the JWS Regional Competition in person, we have decided to compile our thoughts into a chapter as an evaluative exercise and in order to keep us on track with the goals we outlined at the start of the season in the chapter: Managing the Team. We believe that doing a review in this way will help us improve and become better for next time.

== Qualification
In the JWS Regional, they cancelled our practice match because they were runnning behind schedule, which lead to our first ever draw in a VEX match as for Q2 we forgot to fill our pneumatics, which meant that we couldn't possess mogos or score rings onto it. From this we can takeaway that VEX competitions are chaotic and its difficult to predict what is going to happen therefore its important we are as careful as possible to avoid making minor mistakes as they can have match affecting results. For the rest of the competition, we were extremely cautious about our tanks and made sure they were always filled every match.
\
Our second qualifying match - Q11, we played against 10478S Gearers and 13765T MTS_Bubblegum, whilst being allied to 10478B SubZeroRobotics. We lost this match 19-3 because we let them take positive corner first, which gave them a sizable point advantage.
\
However, we managed to win our 5 other matches, winning AWP for 1 of them. This meant that we qualified 4th out of 24 teams. Looking at our objectives, this means that we have definately succeeded with our first objective "A Force to Be Reckoned With".

== Aliance Selection and Elimination
For Alliance Selection, 17711E Entropy were our alliance partner, meaning we made No. 1 Seed for elimination. We picked each other because we were both consistent bots, both with the ability to carry the match if needed to. We won our QF match against 1875N Noodle and 13765T MTS_Bubblegum by securring positive corners.

For the SF we were up against 15650C Memento Mori and 10478S Gearers, in this match both alliances were disqualified because of major violations, that were both match affecting, we were called up on ploughing a mogo whilst possessing one already. This meant that our match had to be replayed. However this time both 15650C and 10478S were able to secure positive corners and auton bonus additionally, which meant that we lost 13-28.

== Skills
Since we didn't have enough time to perfect our autonomous skills before this competition, we didn't submit any autonomous skills runs, which disqualifies us from recieving the Excellence award. We ended doing one drivers skills run, where we obtained 17 points, which placed us 8th out of 16 on the skills leaderboard.
