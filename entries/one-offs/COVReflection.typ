= Introduction
After competing in the Coventry Regional, we have as a team distilled our thoughts and takeaways into a piece of analysis.

= The Competition
== Qualification
This competitiom didn't have the greatest start, since we lost our practise match against 61150W Andromeda and 1408V Venom, whilst partnered with 30110D. We lost that match since 61150W managed to steal our full stack of rings from us, whilst we were fighting for the positive corner. They placed it in the negative corner, which caused us to lose the match. However, losing a practice match and learning from it is a much more desirable outcome than losing a qualifier or elimination match. We ended up winning our first qualifier (Q5) with 46037A Titan against 1408V Venom and 69922G NUAST Tiger, because [insert strategy here]. Unfortunately, we lost Q12 against 15650C Memento Mori and 46846P Subject to Change due to [insert why here]. From this we can take away that... . From there we won all of our remaining qualifiers and we ended up ranking 6th place at the end of qualifications.

== Aliance Selection and Elimination
For Alliance Selection, 13765T MTS_Bubblegum were our alliance partner, with us being 5th seed. 

For the R16#4, we won the match against 6023R StoweBots - Lion and 20785R Rogue quite comfortably, scoring 29-13 in total [since...] . Our next match was the QF, where we played against 6023F Falcon and 20785X Nova. We won against them due to a disqualification involving a <SG11> violation. In this competitiom, there were multiple surprises in this competitiom, namely 1875N Noodle winning against 15650C Memento Mori in Q39 securring them the #1 spot at the end of qualifications and then subsequently in SF1, where 1875N and 15650C lost against 61150W Andromeda and 66618A ATLAS due to [citation needed]. This was significant for us as we were to play whoever won that in the semifinal match. This turn of events meant that we had to play our SF game very differently. Our match was a very low scoring game with a 1 point difference between winner and loser. Andromeda played negative corners very aggressively [verification needed], an unconventional strategy. During the match we had several technical failures, which caused several mistakes in the course of the game. In the last second of the match we were unable to score a ring onto the wallstakes, which would have been a point swing large enough to win us the match. There were several mechanical and strategic reasons that culminated in us losing that match, given that this bot was largely constructed within the timeframe of around a week and a half, it becomes understandable as to why this occurred.
== Skills
Similarly to our last competitiom, we didn't have the time to program any autonomous skills runs and so we settled for doing 1 drivers skill run, in which we scored 29 points, ranking 9th out of 24 participating teams. However, a lack of an autonomous skils score is a serious concern as it means we don't meet the criteria for excellence.

== Interview
We had two judges interviews, our first being a general interview and our second one being focussed about creative problem solving and strategies used in our robots design.

= Notes From Team
It is sometimes very useful to note down what each person initially thinks, as often the 'face value' notes are the most useful to keep in mind.

== Daniel Dew
Coventry was our best look at the national standard so far, the competition is in fact larger than UK Nationals, with the best teams and steepest competition showing up. This competition was an amazing insight to the required strategies, mechanisms, and even code to compete at the highest level. We can take many tips from this competition, in particular in driving strategy; for example, leaving mobile goals unattended is a must _not_, goals must either be carried or flipped to avoid the points being negated.

== Daniel da Silva
On the whole I believe that this was a really important competition for us and our relative successes given our restraints shows that we are a competitive team. Looking forward, we should try be more organised with our time to ensure that we have more time to get the robot working to a standard we are truly proud of.

= Results and Reflection
Overall for our second competition and the context of the timeframe we had prior to this competition, we did exceptionally well. Making 5th seed in arguably the UK's largest tournament, which for reference we made 14th seed at this competition last year, ironically also with 13675T as our alliance captain. Additionally, we managed to win the Create Award and did all of this in under two weeks.

Moving onwards, we need to ensure that we have *enough time* to fit all of the changes, which we plan to make.
