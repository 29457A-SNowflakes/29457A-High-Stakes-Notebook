= Introduction
After competing in the Coventry Regional, we have as a team distilled our thoughts and takeaways into a piece of analysis.

= The Competition
== Qualification
This competitiom didn't have the greatest start, since we lost our practise match against 61150W Andromeda and 1408V Venom, whilst partnered with 30110D. We lost that match since 61150W managed to steal our full stack of rings from us, whilst we were fighting for the positive corner. They placed it in the negative corner, which caused us to lose the match. However, losing a practice match and learning from it is a much more desirable outcome than losing a qualifier or elimination match. We ended up winning our first qualifier (Q5) with 46037A Titan against 1408V Venom and 69922G NUAST Tiger, because [insert strategy here]. Unfortunately, we lost Q12 against 15650C Memento Mori and 46846P Subject to Change due to [insert why here]. From this we can take away that... . From there we won all of our remaining qualifiers and we ended up ranking 6th place at the end of qualifications.

== Aliance Selection and Elimination
For Alliance Selection, 13765T MTS_Bubblegum were our alliance partner, with us being 5th seed. 

For the SF we were up against 15650C Memento Mori and 10478S Gearers, in this match both Red and Blue alliances were disqualified because of major violations, that were both match affecting, we were called up on ploughing a mogo whilst possessing one already. This meant that our match had to be replayed. However this time both 15650C and 10478S were able to secure positive corners and auton bonus additionally, which meant that we lost 13-28. In future, our drive team are looking to ways to avoid this as much as possible as match replays cause shaken confidence and can lead to losing critical matches, which in this case it unfortunately did.

== Skills
Since we didn't have enough time to perfect our autonomous skills before this competition, we didn't submit any autonomous skills runs, which disqualifies us from recieving the Excellence award. We ended doing one drivers skills run, where we obtained 17 points, which placed us 8th out of 16 on the skills leaderboard.

== Interview
Overall, we believe that the interview went fairly well. We discussed practically every aspect of our robots design with the judges and also everyone contributed the conversation at several places throughout the interview.

= Notes From Team
It is sometimes very useful to note down what each person initially thinks, as often the 'face value' notes are the most useful to keep in mind.
//TODO: FILL OUT
== Daniel Dew
Personally, I think the competition was a success, not only becasue we brought home the Judges Award, but also because of the key practice and experience we gained. As the programmer and driver, High Stakes brings several complex problems that seem huge and rather difficult, JWS helped to solve some of those issues and put the game into perspective -- a much needed boost of confidence.
== Jonah
As a member of the drive team and a builder, the competition and promise we showed at JWS really boosted my confidence in what we can achieve in the future. I feel that, since last season, we have improved as a team much more than we realized. Our strategy and driving set us apart as one of the top teams in the UK, even when they didn't always align perfectly with our robot's capabilities.

== Daniel da Silva
In my opinion, I'm very happy with our debut to this season. After a slightly rocky start, we were able to recover and not lose a match until the Semi-Finals, despite this I think the drive team did excellent in the face of difficult opposition. I'm very excited to see how much we improve from here.
== Thomas
In such an unpredictable game like high stakes, coming 4th was a success for us, and we were delighted to alliance with Entropy, which is in my opinion, one of the most powerful teams out there. Despite losing the semi-finals through a very close replayed match, we were thrilled to have not only come away with a judges award, but also a (hopefully!) strengthened bond with Entropy, as,despite losing, our teams worked well together with not only great robots, but great drivers too. Looking back, we have definitely noticed flaws and mistakes in both the robot, and also our game strategy, which will both be duly implemented in time for our next competition. We enjoyed being back competing, and teams will definitely be seeing us again.
== Aubert
As a builder, I thought this was a very important competitiom, it allowed us to get a strong grip on the nuances of this competition in terms of strategy, programming and building. It also allowed us to gain more insight onto what building for this season will entail -- for example, the stress requirements of the drivetrain and surrounding subsystems that can't necessarily be discovered during practice alone.
= Results and Reflection
Overall for our opening competition of the season, we are on the whole quite proud of what we achieved in this competition. We learnt valuable strategic information such as the importance of having an organised pit team and having the robot fully ready before a match. In addition, we played generally quite well winning most of our qualifiers, ranking 4th and getting picked by 1st seed. Additionally, we were awarded the Judges Award as special recognition for our ability and our interview performance.
\
In terms of how this competition puts us in relation to our goals, we are still on track for "A Force to be Reckoned With" making first seed this competition but we did not win an award that qualifies us to nationals at this competition. Winning a worlds qualifying award is not possible at this stage, because there aren't any Signature Events in the UK and none are reasonably close enough to fit into our budget or school routines given we are Year 12 team (equivalent to Junior Year in US). This means that Nationals is a much more important goal to work towards than Worlds currently.
